## What Are Recurring Invoices?

Recurring invoices automatically generate new invoices at specified intervals:

- Weekly subscriptions
- Monthly retainers
- Quarterly services
- Annual contracts

## Creating a Recurring Invoice

### Step 1: Create Base Invoice

1. Create invoice as normal
2. Fill in all details
3. Set up line items
4. Configure payment terms

### Step 2: Enable Recurring

1. Toggle **Recurring**
2. Select recurrence interval:
   - **Weekly:** Every 7 days
   - **Bi-weekly:** Every 14 days
   - **Monthly:** Every month
   - **Quarterly:** Every 3 months
   - **Yearly:** Every year

### Step 3: Set Next Date

1. Choose when first invoice generates
2. System calculates subsequent dates
3. Can be adjusted later

### Step 4: Save Template

- Invoice becomes recurring template
- New invoices generate automatically
- Original invoice acts as template

## How Recurring Invoices Work

### Automatic Generation

- System runs daily (via cron job)
- Checks for invoices due
- Creates new invoices automatically
- Updates recurrence date

### Invoice Details

- New invoice number each time
- Updated dates (issue and due)
- Same line items and amounts
- Same client and settings

### Email Sending

- Respects **Send Invoice on Save** setting
- Sends automatically if enabled
- Uses default email template
- Includes payment links

## Managing Recurring Invoices

2. See all active templates
3. View next generation date
4. Check history

### Edit Recurring Template

- Update amounts
- Change intervals
- Adjust dates

### Pause Recurring

- Disable temporarily
- Keep template for later
- Resume when needed

### Stop Recurring

- Convert to regular invoice
- Stop automatic generation
- Archive template
