## What Are Time-Based Invoices?

Time-based invoices automatically calculate quantities based on date ranges and selected metrics. This feature is perfect for:

- **Hourly billing:** Calculate total hours between dates
- **Daily rates:** Charge per day for services
- **Weekly subscriptions:** Bill for weekly periods
- **Monthly retainers:** Automate monthly billing calculations
- **Project timelines:** Bill based on project duration

## Enabling Date Range Quantity Calculation

### Step 1: Create New Invoice

1. Click **Invoices** in the sidebar
2. Click **New Invoice** from the dropdown
3. Select your client and fill in basic invoice details

### Step 2: Enable Date Range Feature

1. Under **Invoice Actions**, toggle on **"Date Range Quantity Calculation"**
2. This enables date range functionality for all line items

</Note>

## Setting Up Line Items with Date Ranges

### Step 3: Configure Line Item

1. Click **Add Item** to create a new line item
2. Under the line item, toggle on **"Use date range for quantity"**
3. Configure the date range:

   - **Start Date:** When the billing period begins
   - **End Date:** When the billing period ends
   - **Metric:** Choose how quantity is calculated:
     - **Hours:** Total hours between dates
     - **Days:** Total days between dates
     - **Weeks:** Total weeks between dates
     - **Months:** Total months between dates

4. Enter your **Unit Price** (e.g., £50/hour, £200/day)
5. The quantity and total will calculate automatically

### Example Configuration

For a weekly retainer from January 1st to January 31st:

- **Start Date:** January 1, 2024
- **End Date:** January 31, 2024
- **Metric:** Weeks
- **Unit Price:** £500/week
- **Quantity:** Automatically calculates to 4.43 weeks
- **Total:** £2,215.00

## How It Works

### Automatic Calculations

- System calculates the exact quantity based on your selected metric
- Handles partial periods (e.g., 2.5 weeks, 1.3 months)
- Updates in real-time as you adjust dates
- Respects calendar days, not business days

### Date Range Options

- **Hours:** Calculates total hours (24-hour periods)
- **Days:** Calculates calendar days between dates
- **Weeks:** Calculates weeks (7-day periods)
- **Months:** Calculates months (calendar months)

## Best Practices

### When to Use Date Ranges

- **Retainers:** Monthly or weekly recurring services
- **Project billing:** Bill for project duration
- **Hourly work:** Track hours worked over a period
- **Rentals:** Equipment or space rental by day/week/month

### Setting Up Correctly

- **Be precise with dates:** Include exact start and end times
- **Choose appropriate metrics:** Match your billing model
- **Verify calculations:** Review totals before sending
- **Use clear descriptions:** Explain what the date range covers

### Common Use Cases

**Hourly Consulting:**

- Metric: Hours
- Unit Price: Your hourly rate
- Description: "Consulting services - January 2024"

**Monthly Retainer:**

- Metric: Months
- Unit Price: Monthly retainer amount
- Description: "Monthly retainer - Q1 2024"

**Daily Project Rate:**

- Metric: Days
- Unit Price: Daily project rate

## Tips

- Combine with recurring invoices for automated monthly billing
- Use clear line item descriptions to explain the date range
- Review calculated quantities before finalizing
- Adjust unit prices to match your billing structure
- Save as template for similar future invoices

## Limitations

- Date ranges calculate calendar periods, not business days
- Partial periods are calculated precisely (e.g., 2.5 weeks)
- Requires Date Range Quantity Calculation to be enabled
- Each line item can have its own date range

Time-based invoices streamline billing for services delivered over periods!
