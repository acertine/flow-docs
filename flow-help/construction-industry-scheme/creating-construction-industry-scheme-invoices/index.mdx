## Enabling CIS on Invoices

### Step 1: Enable CIS Toggle

1. Create or edit invoice
2. Find CIS section
3. Toggle Enable CIS on
4. Section expands

### Step 2: Set CIS Rate

- If client has CIS: Rate auto-populates
- If no client CIS: Select rate manually
- Options: 0% (Gross), 20% (Standard), 30% (Higher)
- Rate determines deduction

### Step 3: Categorise Line Items

- **Labor:** Construction work (CIS applies)
- **Materials:** Supplies (no CIS)
- **Other:** Miscellaneous (typically no CIS)

## CIS Calculation Process

### Step 1: Categorize Items

- Assign category to each item
- Labor items: CIS deduction applies
- Materials: No deduction
- Other: Check applicability

### Step 2: Calculate Totals

- **Labor value:** Sum of labor items
- **Materials value:** Sum of materials + other
- **Subtotal:** All items total
- **VAT:** Calculated if applicable

### Step 3: Apply CIS Deduction

- CIS rate × Labor value
- Shown as deduction
- Reduces payment due
- Displayed in breakdown

### Step 4: Final Totals

- **Net Payment Due:** Total - CIS deduction
- **Gross Total:** Total before CIS
- **CIS Deduction:** Deduction amount
- Breakdown shown clearly

## CIS Invoice Display

### Invoice Breakdown Shows:

- **Labor Value:** Total labor items
- **Materials & Other:** Total materials
- **CIS Deduction (X%):** Deduction amount
- **Net Payment Due:** Amount after deduction
- **Gross Total:** Total before deduction
